Include these construction-specific items that most generic checklists miss:

1. BANK & CREDIT CARD RECONCILIATION — reconcile operating account, payroll account, and all credit cards. Flag any uncleared items older than 90 days.

2. AR AGING REVIEW — pull AR aging, flag anything over 60 days, cross-reference against draw schedules. Calculate AR Days Outstanding (target: under 45 days for construction).

3. RETAINAGE RECONCILIATION — reconcile retainage receivable (GL 1290) against each job's withheld retainage. Verify retainage payable (GL 2120) matches sub retainage withheld. Flag any retainage eligible for release based on substantial completion.

4. WIP SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS — for each active job, update: costs to date, estimated costs to complete, revised contract amount (including approved COs), and calculate percent complete using cost-to-cost method per ASC 606. Book over/under billing journal entries: Debit 1265 Costs in Excess of Billings (underbilling) or Credit 2480 Billings in Excess of Costs (overbilling).

5. SUBCONTRACTOR ACCRUALS — accrue for work performed but not yet invoiced by subs. Review any joint check agreements for proper recording.

6. PAYROLL ACCRUALS — accrue wages earned but not paid through month-end. Include labor burden (FICA 7.65%, FUTA, SUTA, workers comp at your experience mod rate).

7. EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION — run depreciation for all owned equipment (construction equipment GL 1850, vehicles GL 1840). Verify any new Section 179 elections.

8. JOB COST REVIEW — compare actual vs. estimated costs by cost code for each active job. Flag any job with actual costs exceeding estimated costs to complete by more than 5%. Calculate fade/gain for each project.

9. REVENUE RECOGNITION — ensure YTD revenue on WIP matches income statement. Verify COGS alignment across both reports. Confirm contract assets/liabilities agree with balance sheet.

10. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREP — generate P&L (with job cost detail), balance sheet, cash flow statement. Calculate key ratios: gross margin by job, overhead rate, current ratio, debt-to-equity.

Walk me through a systematic troubleshooting process, starting with the most common construction-specific causes:

1. DRAW DEPOSITS — check if a progress billing payment was received and deposited but posted to the wrong job or wrong income account. Verify draw deposits aren't duplicated between auto-feed and manual entry.

2. RETAINAGE RELEASES — check if a retainage release payment was received but not recorded, or recorded as regular AR payment instead of reducing retainage receivable (GL 1290).

3. OUTSTANDING CHECKS TO SUBS — verify subcontractor checks issued near month-end haven't been voided and reissued (creating a duplicate). Check if any joint check payments were recorded correctly (one check, two payees).

4. PAYROLL TIMING — if payroll spans month-end, verify the split is correct. Check that payroll tax deposits match the bank debits.

5. STANDARD ITEMS — outstanding checks, deposits in transit, bank fees not recorded, interest earned, NSF checks, wire transfers not logged.

6. DUPLICATE TRANSACTIONS — QBO bank feed + manual entry creating doubles. Run a report sorted by amount to find duplicates near $[AMOUNT].

7. PRIOR MONTH CARRYOVER — check if last month's reconciliation was off, as this month inherits that discrepancy.

For each potential cause, tell me exactly what QBO report to run and what to look for. If the discrepancy is a round number (like $500, $1000, $5000), suggest it's likely a single missed transaction. If it's an odd number, suggest it may be multiple items.`,

IMPORTANT 2025+ CHANGE: The filing threshold increases to $2,000 starting with 2026 tax year (filed in 2027). For 2025 filing, the threshold remains $600.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. W-9 AUDIT — Run a vendor list report. For every vendor paid $600+ (or $2,000+ if 2026+), verify:
   - W-9 on file with valid TIN
   - If missing W-9, you should have been backup withholding at 24%. If you didn't, this is a compliance gap.
   - Flag any vendor where W-9 name doesn't match payment name

2. PAYMENT RECONCILIATION — Run a payments-by-vendor report for the full calendar year. Reconcile total 1099-reportable payments to the general ledger. Common discrepancies:
   - Payments coded to materials accounts that were actually sub labor
   - Reimbursements to subs that should be included in their 1099 total
   - Joint check payments — the full amount goes on the sub's 1099, not split

3. EXEMPTION IDENTIFICATION — these do NOT get 1099s:
   - Corporations (S-corps and C-corps) — unless for legal/medical services
   - Payments made via credit card or PayPal (those platforms issue 1099-K)
   - Payments for materials/goods only (no labor component)
   - Employee reimbursements
   - Rent paid to a real estate agent

4. PREVAILING WAGE COMPLIANCE CHECK — if any subs worked on Davis-Bacon or state prevailing wage projects:
   - Were they properly classified as W-2 employees?
   - 1099 workers CANNOT perform covered labor on prevailing wage projects
   - This is a major compliance risk — penalties up to $13,508 per violation after 2025 rule update

5. FILING DEADLINES:
   - January 31: 1099-NEC due to recipients AND to IRS (no extension for NEC)
   - Penalty for late filing: $60-$310 per form depending on how late, up to $660 for intentional disregard

6. STATE FILING — [STATE] requires separate state filing? [YES/NO]. Combined Federal/State Filing program available?

1. SECTION 179 EXPENSING — current year limit $[LIMIT]. List all qualifying equipment, vehicles (over 6,000 lbs GVW for full deduction), and software purchases. Calculate optimal 179 election vs. standard depreciation.

2. BONUS DEPRECIATION — [CURRENT YEAR %] first-year bonus. Coordinate with Section 179 for maximum benefit. New vs. used equipment eligibility.

3. SECTION 179D — Energy-efficient commercial building deduction up to $5.81/sq ft IF prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. CRITICAL: This expires for projects beginning construction after June 30, 2026. Identify any qualifying projects.

4. R&D TAX CREDIT (Section 41) — construction companies often miss this. Qualifying activities include: developing new construction methods, resolving design challenges, prototyping structural solutions, BIM process improvement. Estimate credit at 6-8% of qualifying research expenditures.

5. VEHICLE DEDUCTIONS — for each vehicle, determine: actual expense method vs. standard mileage, Section 179 eligibility (GVW > 6,000 lbs), whether vehicle log is maintained (required for audit defense).

6. DE MINIMIS SAFE HARBOR — expense assets under $2,500 (or $5,000 with audited financials) instead of capitalizing. Have you elected this on your tax return?

7. CONTRACTOR-SPECIFIC DEDUCTIONS OFTEN MISSED:
   - Tool allowances for employees
   - Safety equipment and OSHA compliance costs
   - Continuing education and license renewals
   - Per diem for jobs over 50 miles from home (use federal per diem rates)
   - Home office deduction for construction company owners

2. WORKER CLASSIFICATION — CRITICAL RISK: No 1099/independent contractors can perform covered labor on prevailing wage projects. All workers must be W-2. Verify all subs are properly classifying their workers. If an auditor finds 1099 workers doing covered work, both the sub AND the prime can face penalties up to $13,508 per violation.

3. CERTIFIED PAYROLL REPORTS (WH-347) — must be submitted weekly within 7 days of pay date. Verify:
   - Correct trade classifications and wage rates
   - Fringe benefits paid (cash or bona fide plan)
   - Overtime calculated correctly (1.5x base rate, not prevailing rate in most cases)
   - Apprentice ratios don't exceed allowed limits
   - Statement of Compliance signed

4. FRINGE BENEFITS — calculate: prevailing wage rate is base + fringes. If I pay $35/hr base and prevailing requires $35 base + $15 fringes = $50/hr total. Options: pay fringes in cash (taxable) or through bona fide benefit plans (health, retirement, etc.).

5. SUBCONTRACTOR MONITORING — I'm responsible for ensuring my subs comply. Create a tracking system for: sub certified payroll receipt, verification of sub wage rates, sub fringe benefit documentation.

MY CONTRACTS:
[For each contract, provide: Contract name, Type (lump sum/GMP/cost-plus/T&M), Total value, Expected duration, Payment terms, Any variable consideration (incentives/penalties)]

Walk me through the ASC 606 FIVE-STEP MODEL for each contract:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT
- Is there an enforceable contract with commercial substance?
- Is collectibility probable?
- For combined vs. separate contracts (e.g., base build + separate finish-out): should they be combined as a single contract?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
- Is the entire project a single performance obligation (most common in construction)?
- Or are there distinct deliverables (e.g., design + build = potentially two obligations)?
- Key test: could the customer benefit from each deliverable on its own?

STEP 3: DETERMINE TRANSACTION PRICE
- Fixed price: straightforward
- Variable consideration: incentive/penalty clauses, liquidated damages, shared savings — use "most likely amount" or "expected value" method
- Unpriced change orders: include if approved; for unapproved, include only to the extent it's probable of not being reversed

STEP 4: ALLOCATE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
- If single obligation (typical): entire price allocated to it
- If multiple: allocate based on standalone selling prices

STEP 5: RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME
- Construction almost always qualifies for "over time" recognition because the asset has no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for work performed
- Measure progress: INPUT method (cost-to-cost is most common) or OUTPUT method
- Cost-to-cost: % complete = costs incurred ÷ estimated total costs

JOURNAL ENTRIES NEEDED:
For each period, show the entries for:
- Revenue recognition (earned revenue based on % complete)
- Billing (actual invoices sent)
- Over/under billing adjustments
- Loss recognition (if estimated total cost exceeds contract price)
